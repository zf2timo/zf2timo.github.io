<p>When working with git you <s>should</s> have to use branches. But over the time, there will be a lot of branches that
arn't needed anymore.</p>

<p>To get rid of this waste, i created a script to delete them:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

BRANCHES="$(git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | grep -v "master" | grep -v "develop")"

if [ -z $BRANCHES ]; then
    echo "No branch can deleted safely"
    exit 1;
fi

echo "The following branches will be deleted:"
echo $BRANCHES
echo "Are you sure? (y or n)"
read ANSWER

if [ $ANSWER = "y" ]; then
    echo $BRANCHES | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
fi
</code></pre>

<p>It selects all branches which are merged into master branch and after a confirmation, they will be deleted.</p>

<p>These days most of the internet users use Browser Plugins to block supsicious ad and/or prevent tracking mechanism or similar from working. The most popular plugins are AdBlocker Plus UBlock, NoScript, Privacy Badger - just to name a few. A bit disadvantageous of using your plugin of choice is the mandatory installation in every browser that is used - and therefor additionally settings have to be made several times. Can be a bit stressfull when you ask me.</p>

<p>An alternative way to block suspicious servers is to make use of local host files and redirect the requests to the localhost. But with the huge amount of ad-, tracking- and other mistrustful servers out there it would take a lot of time and effort to to keep the <code>host</code> file up to date.</p>

<p>Thankfully <a href="http://someonewhocares.org">Dan Pollock</a> has done this or rather is still updating the list of mistrustful servers multiple times a week. And thankfully he allows everyone to use this file.</p>

<p>With a few commands on Linux operating system this process of updating can be automated:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">wget -O someonewhocares.hosts http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts; cat someonewhocares.hosts /etc/hosts | grep -v -e "^[[:space:]]*$" | grep -v -e "^#" | sort | uniq &gt; /etc/hosts; rm someonewhocares.hosts
</code></pre>

<p>This is a really long command, which we don't like to enter every time a new version of the list is published. Therefore let us automate the process with a cronjob:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">52,22 */4 * * * wget -O someonewhocares.hosts http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts; cat someonewhocares.hosts /etc/hosts | grep -v -e "^[[:space:]]*$" | grep -v -e "^#" | sort | uniq &gt; /etc/hosts; rm someonewhocares.hosts &gt;&gt; /var/log/cron-host-file-update.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this cronjob has to be registered for the root user. Other users can not write to the <code>host</code> file by default.
Also the time schedule should match you're usage behaviour.</p>

<p>I think, this is a easy solution to block odd server.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2016/10/07/blog-publishing-on-github-with-sculpin">Blog publishing on Github with Sculpin</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>There is a great feature on Github to easily publish a static HTML Page on its servers - like this one you are currently 
reading on. Read through my documentation to find out what my setup and publishing process looks like.</p>

<h2 id="generating-the-static-page">Generating the static Page</h2>

<p>A perfect addition to Github Sites are static Site generators. These tools convert markdown files into HTML files. 
Github promotes Jekyll as a site generator, but you have to hassle with Ruby, therefore I decided to use <a href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a>,
which is written in PHP that is already installed on all of my Workstations. And I am the most experienced with PHP.</p>

<p>After the installation via composer a local server can be started to watch the changes:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ ./vendor/bin/sculpin generate --watch --server
</code></pre>

<p>This server can be accessed via <a href="http://localhost:8000">localhost:8000</a> to view the latest version of the site.
If a change is made in the layout or a post, sculpin re-generates the site automatically for you.</p>

<p>When it's done, new repositories are needed on Github.</p>

<h2 id="preparations-and-limitations">Preparations and Limitations</h2>

<p>The site will be published in an own Repository with a defined naming scheme. These have to be <code>$username.github.io</code> - 
in my case it's <a href="zf2timo.github.io"><code>zf2timo.github.io</code></a>. This name is also the domain name to browse through the blog.</p>

<p>Since I have a simple user Account, the source of the Site has to be in the root of the master branch. There are 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">also options</a> to publish into a sub-folder, 
but these are only available for organisations.
But as I wanted to have the generated site separated from the configuration files for sculpin, too, I had to look 
for another way. 
I found the solution in creating another repository - named <a href="https://github.com/zf2timo/blog-generator"><code>blog-generator</code></a> - 
where all the files for sculpins are versioned.</p>

<p>Now it's time to combine these two repositories.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-to-github">Publishing to Github</h2>

<p>My process to publish the blog involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>switching to the repository <code>blog-generator</code></li>
<li>cloning the <code>zf2timo.github.io</code> repository in a sub-folder, when its not exists</li>
<li>generating the new html files with <code>sculpin</code></li>
<li>copying them into the <code>zf2timo.github.io</code> folder</li>
<li>switching in the sub-folder of <code>zf2timo.github.io</code></li>
<li>committing and pushing all changes to Github</li>
</ul>

<p>In the moment of pushing, the updated version is published (I am sure, there are running some tasks in the background 
on Github, but I didn't noticed a delay yet).</p>

<p>Because this are always the sames steps, I created the <a href="https://github.com/zf2timo/blog-generator/blob/b0aaf4f08963f42aabe24fde3b4e1952fb7e5d79/publish.sh"><code>publish.sh</code></a> 
file, that do all this steps for me and I just have to execute it.</p>
