This blog is based on hugo now.
Actually, I just wanted to take a look at Hugo and play around with it. But everything is so well documented and worked so well that I immediately replaced my old generator for static pages.
Maybe there will be a bit more activity here. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to publish a new post.</description></item><item><title>Delete Old Git Branches</title><link>https://zf2timo.github.io/posts/delete-old-git-branches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:42:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://zf2timo.github.io/posts/delete-old-git-branches/</guid><description>When working with git you should have to use branches. But over the time, there will be a lot of branches that aren&amp;rsquo;t needed anymore.
To get rid of this waste, I created a script to delete them:
#!/usr/bin/env bash BRANCHES=&amp;#34;$(git branch --merged | grep -v &amp;#34;\*&amp;#34; | grep -v &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; | grep -v &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34;)&amp;#34; if [ -z $BRANCHES ]; then echo &amp;#34;No branch can deleted safely&amp;#34; exit 1; fi echo &amp;#34;The following branches will be deleted:&amp;#34; echo $BRANCHES echo &amp;#34;Are you sure?</description></item></channel></rss>
